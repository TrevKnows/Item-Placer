# Item-Placer

This Item placer app is one of my first ARKit applications. In this project includes Plane detection, 3D model placement and anchor points
to recogniz P.O.I (Points Of Interest).

Next we'll be I'll be adding:
• "Hit Detection" - Allowing the 3D models to detect ALL surface as well 
• Model animation loading and and 
• Dynamic animataion - This would be a model standing on a surface, and jumping down from one surface to another.
